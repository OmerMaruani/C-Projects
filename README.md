# Project1: RatATat Game

This project implements the *RatATat* card game for 2-6 players, where the first player is AI and the rest are human. Players aim to have the lowest card value by drawing, swapping, and using special cards. The game ends when a player declares "RatATat." Key files include `Player.h`, `Card.h`, and `RatATat.h`, which define the game logic and player interactions.
